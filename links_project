Applied Mathematics

You should have a solid understanding of statistics, as it will be needed for making decisions for evaluation of experiments. Knowledge of calculus and linear algebra helps in using the results of a machine learning or statistical implementation in a different case independently.



Data cleaning and visualisation

Do not think that data will be readily available to you for processing. Often a great deal of time is spent in cleaning the data, adjusting missed values, correcting formatting. Without this, data cannot be processed to further stages.



Software engineering

A strong software engineering background is the most essential requirement. You should have a clear understanding of algorithms, data structures, memory management which will be always tested in the first rounds for the data science roles.
