    "##### Reinforcement Learning: Reinforcement Learning is a powerful branch of Machine Learning. It is used to solve interacting problems where the data observed up to time t is considered to decide which action to take at time t + 1. It is also used for Artificial Intelligence when training machines to perform tasks such as walking. Desired outcomes provide the AI with reward, undesired with punishment. Machines learn through trial and error.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reinforcement learning use for trained robots to walk. \n",
    "* When create a AI robot dog, implement a reinforcement learning for walk, say all action for walk to dog. if peform well then give reward else punishment. (Reward = 1, punishment = 0)\n",
    "* So if actions are good and correct  to try to repeat more and more.\n",
    "* So they can learn to walk and find a way to walk on their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The multi armed Bandit Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is Multi armed bandit problem, it is a game machine. handle on right. pull the handle or lever to initiate the game. \n",
    "* Why they called bandit, because these machine are quickiest way to loose money in casino. 50 % chance to loose money 50 % chance to win.\n",
    "* This one is one armed, so many machine like this called multi armed bandit. \n",
    "* So how to maximize the profit by these by playing many times. \n",
    "* Assumption is: Each machine has distribution. \n",
    "* So goal is to figure out which one is best distribution for you.\n",
    "* So when you know the distribution you will figure it out how to put money in which bandit.\n",
    "* You need to explore the machine and same time exploit machine.\n",
    "* Regret is not use optimal method\n",
    "* At the end we need to find how to bet maximize your return.\n",
    "* We agree behind every machine there is a certain distribution but we dont know, we need to combine explore these machine with explotation in order to find out which machine is best. \n",
    "* Then perform A/B test for find best.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Steps:\n",
    "1. We have d arms. For example arms are ads that we display to users each time they connect to a web page\n",
    "2. Each time user connects to this web page, that makes a round\n",
    "3. At each round n, we choose one ad to display to the user\n",
    "4. At each round n, ad i gives reward ri(n) belogs to (0,1): if user clicks on ad then give 1 else 0\n",
    "5. Our goal is to maximize the total reward we get over rounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### UPPER CONFIDENCE BOUND: How this algorithm works\n",
    "##### Steps:\n",
    "1. It assume, that for every distribution there is some starting point. \n",
    "2. According to algorithm they create a confidence Band. It is design in a such a way high level of certainty. \n",
    "3. it returns expected value. \n",
    "4. If any machine get up then we start exploring that machine.\n"
